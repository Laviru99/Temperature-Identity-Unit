Project : Arduino DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Project


This project is an Arduino-based system that monitors and displays temperature and humidity data using a DHT11 sensor and an LCD screen.
The system continuously reads data from the DHT11 sensor and shows the temperature and humidity on a 16x2 LCD display.
If the temperature exceeds a specified threshold, the system clears the display and calculates the elapsed time since the program started, showing the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds on the LCD.

Technologies: Arduino, DHT11 Sensor, LCD Display, SimpleDHT Library, SPI Library
Execution: Code is uploaded to the Arduino board and reads data in real-time from the DHT11 sensor
Purpose: To monitor and display temperature and humidity data with real-time tracking of elapsed time when a certain temperature threshold is crossed.
